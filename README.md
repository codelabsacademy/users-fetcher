# Code Labs Academy - Users Fetcher

## Introduction

This is one of the coding challenges for the Fundamentals unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Challenge description

The challenge is to build out a simple web application that fetches users Data. You will be using the following [API](https://reqres.in/api/users).

When the user clicks on the refresh button, users data will be fetched and displayed

We already prepared the HTML and the CSS for you. Now your mission is to complete the `script.js` file so that our web application gets functional. You can check the issues to get some hints!

**Happy coding!** ðŸ˜„
